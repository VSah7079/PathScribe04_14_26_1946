// src/pages/SynopticReportPage/hooks/useOrchestratorDraft.ts
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Extracted from SynopticReportPage.tsx as part of the same incremental
// cleanup that produced the other hooks in this directory — see
// useLisIntegration.ts's header for the full rationale.
//
// This is a narrower, more honest scope than "the orchestrator state
// cluster" as a whole. orchSections and activeSectionId themselves stay
// in the main component — both are read directly in JSX (section
// editor props, tab-switch guards) and by other already-extracted hooks
// (useReportGeneration, useSignOutWorkflow), so moving the state itself
// would mean either dragging those concerns in too or splitting the
// state from its own usage. Same reasoning as caseData/orchSections in
// every earlier extraction tonight. What moves here is the DRAFT
// LIFECYCLE logic that operates on that state: save, restore-on-load,
// and sync-to-diagnostic.
//
// Deliberately NOT included: handleConcurrencyForceSave. It's defined
// very early in the main file (before orchSections is even declared —
// it only works via closure, since the function isn't actually called
// until well after mount) and duplicates part of saveDraftInternal's
// own logic (same isOrchCaseId check, same caseRouter.updateCase +
// localStorage.setItem pattern) rather than reusing it. That
// duplication is a real, separate observation worth a dedicated look
// later — folding it into this extraction now would either require
// reordering its definition (risky, unclear downstream effects) or
// accepting a second copy of the same save logic living inside this
// hook too. Neither is clean, so it stays where it is for now.
//
// SECOND HALF OF THIS EXTRACTION — pulled inline JSX closures into
// named functions:
// handleSectionTextChange, handleAcceptSection, handleAcceptDraft,
// handleKeepVersion, and handleAcceptAllSections were previously
// anonymous arrow functions written directly as OrchestratorSectionEditor
// JSX props (onSectionChange, onAcceptSection, onAcceptDraft,
// onKeepVersion, onAcceptAll) in the main file. Each one contains real
// business logic — what counts as a user edit, how a pending AI draft
// gets promoted to the committed version, what "accept all" means —
// not just event wiring. Per explicit direction to minimize business
// logic living in the UI/JSX layer, these are pulled out here as named,
// independently readable functions; the JSX now just wires each prop to
// the named function, same as every other handler in this file.
