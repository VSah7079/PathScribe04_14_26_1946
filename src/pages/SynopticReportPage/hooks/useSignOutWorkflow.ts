// src/pages/SynopticReportPage/hooks/useSignOutWorkflow.ts
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Extracted from SynopticReportPage.tsx as the second half of a two-part
// extraction (amendment first, then this) that was originally scoped as
// two separate domains but turned out to be genuinely, deeply cross-
// called — see useAmendmentWorkflow.ts's header for the full rationale.
//
// PURE MOVE, not a rewrite — every function body is unchanged.
//
// This hook depends on useAmendmentWorkflow's output: both
// releasePendingAmendmentOrAddendum and openAmendmentDraft are received
// as parameters here, not redefined. That's the real call-graph
// direction — handlePreFinalConfirm and handleFinalizeConfirm both call
// finalizeCase() then releasePendingAmendmentOrAddendum() in sequence,
// and handleFinalizeConfirm calls openAmendmentDraft() directly on the
// deferred-synoptic-completion path.
//
// STATE OWNED HERE (moved in fully — verified via grep that each is
// only used within this file's original boundary or in JSX, before
// moving): missingFields, showMissingWarning, reviewFields,
// showAiReview, finalizeAndNextPending, showPreFinalise,
// preFinalSynoptics, deferredAmendmentContext.
//
// STATE DELIBERATELY NOT OWNED HERE, received as parameters instead:
//   - activeReportInstanceId, orchSections: too central/widely-read
//     elsewhere, same reasoning as every prior extraction tonight.
//   - countersignFeedback: defined earlier in the main file, read in
//     JSX (a feedback textarea), so it stays there.
//   - fixativeGateSpecimens/setFixativeGateSpecimens,
//     pendingFinalizeArgs/setPendingFinalizeArgs: defined near the top
//     of the component (before this domain's original boundary) and
//     read directly in JSX for the FixativeTimeGateModal — stay in the
//     main file, only the setters are threaded through.
//   - specimenDictionary: comes from the pre-existing
//     useSpecimenDictionary() hook.
//   - setCaseSigned, showSignOutModal/setShowSignOutModal,
//     setAmendmentMode, setShowAmendmentModal, setShowFinalizeModal:
//     come from the pre-existing useSynopticModals() hook.
//   - pendingReconciliation/setPendingReconciliation: defined before
//     this domain's boundary, drives the FrozenToPermanentReconciliation
//     modal directly in JSX.
//   - sendSynopticReportToLis: from useLisIntegration.
//   - generateReportPdfSnapshot: stays in the main component (reads
//     resolvedContext/orchSections directly).
//   - releasePendingAmendmentOrAddendum, openAmendmentDraft: from
//     useAmendmentWorkflow, per the dependency direction above.
