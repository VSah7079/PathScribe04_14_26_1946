# pages/system/

Admin config pages rendered by `Config/System/index.tsx`'s route switch.
Currently holds one page; more may land here as other `Config/System/`
sections get split out of their current homes.

## Files

- **`ClientDictionaryPage.tsx`** — Admin config page for Facility
  Configuration (route: `/system/clients` — file/route names kept as
  `Client*`, only user-facing text was renamed; see
  `components/ClientDictionary/README.md`). Reconciled June 2026: previously
  ran on `contexts/useClientDictionary.ts`, a synchronous
  localStorage-backed hook with its own disconnected `Client` type and ID
  scheme (`client-INT-001` etc.), completely separate from
  `services/facilities/mockFacilityService.ts` — the store every other screen
  (Accession page, TAT Configuration, Subspecialties, Routing Rules,
  Validation Studies) and existing case seed data (`order.clientId`)
  actually use. Now wired to the same `facilityService` as everything else,
  so a facility added here shows up everywhere, and vice versa.
  `useClientDictionary.ts` has been retired. Correctly reuses the shared
  `ConfirmModal` for the "facility still referenced" deactivation guard
  rather than reimplementing it.

  **Fixed this review:** two inline `style={{...}}` blocks (the loading
  state, and the header's flex row) — real violations of the
  no-inline-styles rule. Replaced with new `.config-section-loading` and
  `.config-section-header-row` classes, added to `pathscribe.css` next to
  the rest of the `.config-section-*` family (Section 10, CONFIG / ADMIN
  SECTIONS). See `PRIORITY_FIXES.md` for the wider inline-style finding
  this surfaced.

## Notes

The `.config-section-header-row` pattern (flex, space-between,
flex-start) is duplicated near-verbatim under several other class names
elsewhere in `pathscribe.css` (`.ps-del-header` appears 4 times,
`.ps-sub-header` twice, `.ps-tat-header`, `.ps-tat-client__section-header`,
`.ps-tat-trend__header`) — a broader class-duplication pattern, not fixed
here since it's a different, larger problem than this file's own inline
styles. Not logging a new tracking entry for it yet; flagging here so
it's not lost if a future CSS consolidation pass happens.
