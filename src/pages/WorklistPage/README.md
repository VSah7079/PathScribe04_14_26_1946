# pages/WorklistPage/

The main case worklist — filter tiles, the case table (rendered via
`components/Worklist/WorklistTable.tsx`, documented separately in
`components/Worklist/README.md`), and the supporting modals/tiles
specific to this page.

## Files

- **`WorklistPage.tsx`** (871 lines) — the page itself: LIS/Outreach
  context switching, the filter-tile strip, stats computation, and the
  page title above the table.

  **Real bugs found and fixed in a review pass** (`PRIORITY_FIXES.md`
  item #54): page title and tile label were two completely independent
  hardcoded strings (`FILTER_TITLES` map vs. each tile's own inline
  label) that had already drifted apart in several places — most
  visibly, selecting "Amendment & Addenda" showed "Amended Cases" as
  the page title. Also found: `countersign` wasn't in the title map at
  all, silently falling back to the generic "Active Cases" title, and
  `grosscomplete`/`urgent`/`draft` each had a different string in the
  title than on their own tile. Fixed properly, not patched: replaced
  both hardcoded copies with one shared `FILTER_LABELS` map that both
  the title and every tile's label read from — the specific class of
  drift that caused this is now structurally impossible, not just
  fixed for the one reported case.

  Also fixed in the same pass: the Urgent tile showed a bare count with
  no indication that pool-status (unassigned) urgent cases existed
  separately — added a "2 Restricted" sublabel, using an existing
  `sublabel` field already wired into the tile rendering but never
  populated by any tile before this. And a real colorblind-accessibility
  gap — `delegated` and `accessioned` tiles used the literal same color
  (`#38bdf8` vs `#38BDF8`, differing only in letter casing), plus two
  near-duplicate pairs (the two violets, the two oranges) that would be
  hard to distinguish. Reassigned three tile colors to resolve both;
  left the other nine alone since they were already reasonably distinct
  and semantically sensible (red/green/gray for urgent/completed/draft
  in particular).

  **Extended further** (`PRIORITY_FIXES.md` item #55, in
  `WorklistTable.tsx`/`poolGrouping.ts` rather than this file directly
  — see `components/Worklist/README.md`): unassigned-and-urgent cases
  now sort to the very top of the whole list, and the Urgent/All Cases
  divider bars inside the table also show their own restricted-count
  breakdown, mirroring the tile fix above.

- **`AmendedAddendaTriageTile.tsx`** (94 lines) — the "Amendment &
  Addenda Triage" summary tile, built to an explicit spec documented in
  its own header: inbound LIS amendment notices awaiting review, open
  (draft) amendment records, and open (draft) addendum records. Two
  named exit conditions (clerical review-marked elsewhere; clinical —
  only leaves once the draft is actually released/re-finalized), both
  documented directly in the file rather than left implicit. Not
  reviewed in depth this session beyond confirming it's real, wired-up,
  and not dead code.

- **`ResourcesModal.tsx`** (45 lines) — the shared quick-links modal
  (protocols/references/internal systems), opened via the global
  `PATHSCRIBE_PAGE_OPEN_RESOURCES` window event — see
  `pages/README.md`'s `AuditLogPage.tsx` entry for a real bug found
  elsewhere where a page rendered this same modal but never listened
  for that event at all. This page's own listener was confirmed
  correctly wired. Not reviewed in further depth this session.

## Notes

- This folder previously had no README at all, despite
  `pages/README.md`'s own header already listing `WorklistPage/`
  alongside `AccessionPage/` as one of the subfolder pages — a real
  documentation gap, closed here rather than left for later.
- The case table itself, its pool-grouping/sorting logic, and the
  claim-workflow modal all live in `components/Worklist/`, documented
  there rather than duplicated here — this page owns filtering/tiles/
  context, that folder owns the table and its row-level behavior.
