# components/Editor/

The rich text editor (Tiptap-based) used throughout PathScribe for
narrative report content, plus `tiptapBridge/` (renamed from
`integration/` — see Notes) — the bridge layer that lets the Orchestrator
Engine drive the editor programmatically (streaming AI content into
specific sections without corrupting user edits elsewhere).

**Pattern:** `PathScribeEditor.tsx` is the real Tiptap component;
`NarrativeEditor.tsx` is a thin props-forwarding wrapper; `tiptapBridge/`
is pure logic (no React) bridging the editor to the AI orchestrator.

## Files

- **`PathScribeEditor.tsx`** (1018+ lines) — The real editor: full
  toolbar (formatting, tables, alignment, macros), macro hotkey extension,
  multi-instance shared toolbar support, user-configurable tab width.
  Exposes `PathScribeEditorHandle` via `forwardRef`.

  **FIXED — real theming bug, not cosmetic.** `DARK_THEME`'s
  `contentBg`/`contentText` were hardcoded to `'white'`/a dark-text color
  even when `theme="dark"` was explicitly selected — meaning the dark
  theme option only ever affected the toolbar chrome, never the actual
  writing surface, undermining the point of the option existing. Found
  via a real usability report: the Case/Specimen Comment modals (embedding
  this editor) had just been given a dark-themed shell, but the editor
  itself inside them stayed a plain white box, illegible against the
  new dark surroundings. Now genuinely dark end-to-end when selected.

  **NEW — real user-facing theme toggle**, not just a fixed default per
  screen. `allowThemeToggle` prop shows a real sun/moon button in the
  toolbar; `theme` prop is now only the *starting point* — once a user
  has ever clicked the toggle anywhere it appears, that becomes their
  real preference (persisted to `localStorage`), shared across every
  editor instance that opts in, overriding whatever default any
  individual screen was built with. Off by default so contexts that
  shouldn't show it (e.g. a small font preview box) don't get one
  uninvited. First real usages: `Case`/`Specimen` Comment modals
  (`pages/Synoptic/Comments/`), both defaulting to dark with the toggle
  available. **Confirmed via direct test that `OrchestratorSectionEditor.tsx`
  — the one pre-existing consumer already using `theme="dark"` — is
  completely unaffected**, since it doesn't pass `allowThemeToggle` and
  therefore never enters the new stateful/persisted code path at all.

- **`NarrativeEditor.tsx`** — Thin wrapper forwarding props/ref to
  `PathScribeEditor.tsx`. No issues.
- **`PathScribeEditorRef.ts`** — Defines `PathScribeEditorHandle`, the
  imperative ref interface (getEditor/insertAtPos/appendToken/setContent/
  clearContent/focus/isEditable/setEditable) that the Orchestrator Engine
  and `NarrativeEditor.tsx` use to drive the editor without going through
  React props. Single real source of truth for that interface.
- **`tiptapBridge/anchorMap.ts`** — Tracks each narrative section's
  position in the Tiptap document via `data-section-id` paragraph
  attributes, so content can be inserted/replaced at the right spot
  without corrupting unrelated user edits. No issues.
- **`tiptapBridge/aiContentMarkers.ts`** — Marks AI-generated vs.
  user-edited node ranges via node attributes (not marks/decorations,
  deliberately — survives undo/redo). No issues.
- **`tiptapBridge/insertAtAnchor.ts`** — Safe content insertion at
  section-specific positions, protects user-edited content from being
  overwritten. No issues.
- **`tiptapBridge/streamingWriter.ts`** — Bridges Orchestrator token
  streaming into the editor, one `StreamingSession` per section, supports
  cancellation mid-stream. Sole external consumer:
  `orchestrator/orchestratorEngine.ts`. No issues.

## Notes

- **Real duplicate-type drift risk, fixed:** `PathScribeEditor.tsx` used
  to declare its own separate `export interface PathScribeEditorHandle`,
  structurally identical to the one in `PathScribeEditorRef.ts` — but
  every external consumer already imported the `PathScribeEditorRef.ts`
  version. Consolidated to one declaration.
- `PathScribeEditorRef.ts`'s "HOW TO ADD THIS" comment block reads like a
  pending implementation guide but the pattern is already fully
  implemented — added a status note so it's clearly read as
  historical/reference documentation, not a to-do.
- **RENAMED: `integration/` → `tiptapBridge/`.** Checked and confirmed
  correctly placed under `components/` (these 4 files are fundamentally
  Tiptap/ProseMirror-specific, operate on live `Editor`/`Transaction`/
  `Decoration` internals, can't be abstracted from the editor library
  without a rewrite) — same established pattern as `PathScribeEditorRef.ts`
  (also consumed from outside this folder). Renamed only because
  `integration/` didn't signal "Tiptap-specific" to someone skimming
  folder names. All internal path comments + the one external import
  (`orchestratorEngine.ts`) updated; confirmed zero dangling references.
