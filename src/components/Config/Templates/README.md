# components/Config/Templates/

Admin protocol/template review workflow — the review queue list and the
full-page lifecycle reviewer.

**Pattern:** Standard page-pair (list → detail), plus one confirmed,
non-trivial open bug.

## Files

- **`AdminTemplateList.tsx`** — Template review queue list. Thin, correct —
  single mock entry today, navigates to `/template-review/:templateId`.
- **`TemplateRenderer.tsx`** — Full-page protocol reviewer, reached via
  `/template-review/:templateId`. Excellent self-documented lifecycle model
  (draft → in_review → approved → published, with needs_changes as a
  rejection branch, reset as an admin escape hatch) and source-aware
  terminology (CAP "Accept/Release" vs RCPath "Ratify/Publish" vs
  ICCR/Custom "Approve/Publish"). **KNOWN BUG, see Notes.**

## Notes

- **BUG FIXED (July 2026).** `TemplateRenderer.tsx` was fully rewritten to
  fetch real content via `services/templates/templateService.ts`'s
  `getTemplate(templateId)` and render the actual `EditorTemplate` shape
  (`EditorSection`/`EditorField`, from `../Protocols/SynopticEditor.tsx`)
  directly — the same rich model the real template builder authors, with
  6 field types and per-field/per-option SNOMED/ICD coding (which the old
  renderer couldn't display at all; new `CodingBadges` component adds it).
  19 real generic (post-CAP/RCPath-licensing-cleanup) templates are
  already seeded in `editorStore` and now display correctly. Protocols
  with no authored content yet show an explicit empty state with a link
  to the editor, instead of fabricated placeholder content.
  **Deleted as fully dead, confirmed via full-`src/` grep, zero remaining
  references anywhere:** `types/templateTypes.ts` (its `AuditEvent`/
  `TemplateLifecycleState` exports were already an orphaned duplicate of
  the real `types/AuditEvent.ts`, which everything else in the app
  correctly used instead) and `src/templates/mockDcisTemplate.ts` (typed
  against the now-deleted schema). `src/templates/` is now an empty
  folder. Full before/after schema comparison in
  `../Protocols/README.md`.
- Not attempted, worth a look separately: `ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS`/
  `LIFECYCLE_STYLES` don't have an entry for `'deprecated'`
  (`TemplateStatus = LifecycleState | 'deprecated'` in
  `templateService.ts`) — falls back safely via `??` today, but a
  genuinely deprecated template would just render with draft styling
  rather than something more explicit. Pre-existing, not introduced by
  this rewrite.
