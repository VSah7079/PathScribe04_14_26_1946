# components/

Master index for `src/components/`. One line per top-level folder,
cross-linked to that folder's own `README.md` for real detail.

**Maintenance rule:** when a folder's *contents* change, update that
folder's own `README.md`. Only touch *this* file if a folder's *purpose*
changes, or a folder is added/removed/split/merged.

## Folder index (23 folders, all reviewed)

| Folder | What it is |
|---|---|
| [Config/](./Config/README.md) | Every admin/configuration screen β€” 54 files across 11 subfolders, see its own index |
| [TemplateBuilder/](./TemplateBuilder/README.md) | Report *layout/assembly* builder β€” distinct from Config/Protocols/'s synoptic *data-capture* templates |
| [Editor/](./Editor/README.md) | Tiptap rich text editor + `tiptapBridge/` (AI-integration bridge) |
| [Voice/](./Voice/README.md) | Voice dictation settings/controls |
| [ClientDictionary/](./ClientDictionary/README.md) | Client Dictionary table + editor modal |
| [Contribution/](./Contribution/README.md) | My Contribution dashboard β€” 5 tabs/tiles, all serving `ContributionDashboardPage.tsx` |
| [Common/](./Common/README.md) + Button/ | Shared UI primitives: `ConfirmModal`, `LookupModal`, `InlineCommentThread`, `SuffixSelect`, `Dropdown`, `LogoutWarningModal`, `SessionExpiryWarningModal`, `DraftRecoveryModal`, `SessionSupersededNotice` |
| [QualityAssurance/](./QualityAssurance/README.md) | 6 QA/compliance reporting tabs (Countersign Turnaround, Intraop Linkage, Reconciliation, FPPE/Credentialing, Post-Finalization Drift, Patient Match Review) β€” newly indexed this session, the folder existed but had no README and was missing from this list entirely until now |
| [Worklist/](./Worklist/README.md) | Case worklist table |
| [Icons/](./Icons/README.md) | Icon components |
| [Flags/](./Flags/README.md) | Flag display components |

## Naming/structure pass (July 2026)

Prompted by a direct question: does `Common/` being this thin, in a
codebase this size, actually make sense? It didn't β€” the deeper look
found several folders whose *names* didn't communicate their contents,
independent of whether the code itself was correct. Renamed/consolidated:

| Old | New | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `system/` (lowercase) | `ClientDictionary/` | Collided by capitalization only with `Config/System/` (a much bigger, unrelated folder); told you nothing about Client Dictionary being what's inside |
| `UI/` | folded into `Common/` | Single-file folder named as generically as possible; `ConfirmModal.tsx` is exactly the same category of thing as `Common/LookupModal.tsx` |
| `PatientReportPage/` | folded into `Common/` | The page that name referred to was deleted as dead code earlier this session; only `InlineCommentThread.tsx` (a genuinely shared component) was left behind in a folder named after something that no longer existed |
| `AccessionPage/` | `SpecimenPicker/` | Identical name to `pages/AccessionPage/`, a completely different folder β€” this one is just a picker component, not the page |
| `CasePanel/` | `PatientHistory/` | Gave no signal the folder contains the patient history modal specifically β€” no other "case panel" concept existed to distinguish it from |
| `synoptic/` (lowercase) | `Synoptic/` | The only folder in all of `components/` breaking PascalCase convention |
| `Dashboards/` | folded into `Contribution/` | Both files (`FlagRow.tsx`, `CaseMixTile.tsx`) exclusively serve `ContributionDashboardPage.tsx` β€” same audience as everything already in `Contribution/`; "Dashboards" (plural, generic) didn't say which dashboard |

**Kept as-is, deliberately** β€” flagged as overloaded terminology rather
than renamed, since each name is individually accurate for what it
contains:

- **"Search"** means three different things depending on folder β€”
  `components/Search/CaseSearchBar.tsx` (global case search),
  `Config/Search/ConfigSearchBar.tsx` (Configuration page's own search),
  and `pages/SearchPage.tsx` (the dedicated SNOMED/ICD/specimen lookup
  page). Each is correctly named for what it does; the overlap is only
  confusing if you forget which folder you're in.
- **"Template"** means genuinely different things in `Config/Protocols/`
  (data-capture) vs. `TemplateBuilder/` (report layout) vs.
  `TemplateRequest/` (a request form for a new one) β€” already documented
  in `TemplateBuilder/README.md`'s own Notes section.
- **"Review"** means different things in `RequestReview/` (ask a
  colleague to informally look at a case) vs. `Config/Protocols/ReviewQueueSection.tsx`
  (formal protocol lifecycle review) β€” different domains, not a naming
  mistake.
- **"Editor"** means different things in `components/Editor/` (Tiptap
  narrative writing surface) vs. `Config/Protocols/SynopticEditor.tsx`
  (structured template *definition* builder) β€” a fourth confirmed
  instance of this same pattern, prompted by a direct question and
  checked rather than assumed correct. See `Config/Protocols/README.md`.

Every rename above: confirmed sole/all real consumers via full-`src/`
grep before moving, updated every import path and self-documented header
comment, verified zero dangling references afterward, and ran each moved
file through `esbuild` as a syntax/resolution sanity check (this
environment has no `tsconfig`/`node_modules` for a real `tsc` run β€” that
remains the first real check on your end).

## Known issues found across components/

- **Macros/index.tsx hardcoded fonts** (Config/) β€” drift risk vs.
  `services/fonts/`.
- **Hardcoded `isSuperAdmin={true}`** (Config/System/) β€” see
  `ACCESS_CONTROL_PLAN.md` at repo root. Planned, not blocking, revisit
  before first real customer deployment.
- **`TemplatePreviewPanel.tsx` still on the old node-list preview shape**
  (TemplateBuilder/) β€” works correctly today via a real adapter, not
  urgent.

## Fixes applied across components/

See `Config/README.md`'s own fixes log for full detail on the Config/
subfolder work β€” summarized here for a single cross-folder view:

- `Staff/RoleDictionary.tsx`, `ClientDictionary/ClientTable.tsx` β€” stale
  header path comments fixed.
- **Orchestrator Mode** β€” real, previously-nonfunctional toggle rebuilt
  with org default + per-internal-client override
  (`Client.internalAiOrchestratorEnabled`). Dead `NarrativeTemplatesTab`
  cluster deleted.
- **`CaseRoutingSection.tsx` β†’ `CasePoolAssignmentSection.tsx`** rename,
  matching the services/ side.
- **`specimenTypes.ts` relocated** from `components/Config/System/` to
  `services/specimenDictionary/` β€” was an inverted dependency. Caught by
  Pete.
- **Participation-types consolidation** β€” `Config/System/ParticipationTypesSection.tsx`
  and `Config/Staff/RoleDictionary.tsx` each maintained a separate,
  disconnected local list of participation types, drifted to different
  type membership entirely from `services/participationTypes/mockParticipationTypeService.ts`
  (the real service `CaseTeamModal.tsx` actually uses). Found by tracing
  a user-reported drag-and-drop bug back through the data layer. Both
  screens now use the real service directly; final 8-type canonical list
  defined by Pete against real CLIA/CAP/ACGME clinical role requirements.
  `TypeModal.tsx`'s mojibake β€” previously assessed here as cosmetic
  comments-only β€” turned out to include a separate instance actually
  rendering wrong in the live UI across all 9 admin screens sharing that
  modal; traced to root cause via raw bytes and fixed. Same investigation
  also surfaced a critical Demo Reset bug: `CASE_KEYS` referenced
  `'ps_cases'`, a key `mockCaseService.ts` never actually wrote to (real
  key: `'cases'`) β€” Demo Reset had likely never correctly cleared primary
  case data. Full detail in `Config/README.md`, `Config/Staff/README.md`,
  `Config/System/README.md`.
- **`TemplateRenderer.tsx` fully rewritten** to consume real
  `EditorTemplate` content via `getTemplate()` instead of a hardcoded
  placeholder β€” 19 real seeded templates now display correctly, plus new
  SNOMED/ICD coding display. `types/templateTypes.ts` and
  `src/templates/mockDcisTemplate.ts` deleted as fully dead.
- **Orphaned third protocol-editing system deleted** β€” `src/protocols/`
  and `src/types/ProtocolDefinition.ts`, plus the unreachable route in
  `App.tsx`. Caught by Pete.
- **`PathScribeEditorHandle` duplicate declaration consolidated**
  (Editor/) β€” now a single source of truth in `PathScribeEditorRef.ts`.
- **`Editor/integration/` renamed to `Editor/tiptapBridge/`** for clarity.
- **`system/clients/desktop.ini` deleted** β€” Windows Explorer metadata
  file, not source code. Recommend adding `desktop.ini` to `.gitignore`.
- **`Common/Button/Button.test.tsx` deleted** β€” confirmed empty scaffold,
  no `Button.tsx` ever existed.
- **`PatientReportPage.tsx` deleted** β€” routed but genuinely unreachable;
  every real navigation goes to `/case/${id}/synoptic` instead. Confirmed
  with Pete. `mock/mockReports.ts` kept β€” still used by `FullReportPage.tsx`.
- `Audit/useAuditLog.ts` β€” removed a literally duplicated header comment.
- **Full naming/structure pass** β€” see the table above. 7 folders
  renamed or consolidated; every move verified via grep + esbuild.
- **`RequestReviewModal.tsx`'s reviewer list rebuilt** on the real
  `services/users/mockUserService.ts` directory (filtered to active
  Pathologists), replacing a standalone hardcoded array that had drifted
  into real ID collisions with `AppShell.tsx`'s directory. Collision-free
  by construction now, not just patched around.
- **PRIORITY_FIXES.md #8 β€” CLOSED. Modal-overlay shell consolidation,
  all 14 files.** What started as `components/UI/ConfirmModal.tsx` found
  with exactly 1 real consumer became a full sweep across
  `LogoutWarningModal.tsx`, `ResourcesModal.tsx`, `EnhancementRequestModal.tsx`
  (already correct, confirmed), `AuditLogPage.tsx`, `ConfigurationPage.tsx`,
  `AppShell.tsx`, `SynopticEditor.tsx`, `protocolShared.tsx`,
  `TemplateRenderer.tsx`, `PathScribeEditor.tsx`, `SynopticReportPage.tsx`,
  `AddCodeModal.tsx`, plus `Home.tsx` (found along the way, with two of
  its own duplicate modals eliminated by reuse rather than reformatted a
  third time) and `AuditLogPage.tsx`'s own third copy of the same Quick
  Links modal.
- **`LogoutWarningModal.tsx` consolidation**, prompted directly by Pete
  given the reliability stakes of `SynopticReportPage.tsx` β€” a second,
  separate implementation with a different prop interface and its own
  uncorrected z-index bug was found in that page's own `modals/` folder
  and merged into one shared `Common/LogoutWarningModal.tsx`. Same
  investigation found and removed a dead `overlayStyle` prop across four
  of that page's other modals, plus one redundant CSS modifier.
- **Session Security β€” Phase 1 of the Inactivity Timeout & Draft Recovery
  feature, complete.** A real idle-detection timer, honest warning modal,
  and forced logout, closing a genuine gap: `AuthContext.tsx` had no
  timeout mechanism at all, while the audit log had two fabricated demo
  entries falsely implying one had worked successfully in the past
  (removed immediately, ahead of any diligence review). Resolved per the
  currently-open case (org default, overridden by whichever client
  performs the work on that case) rather than a multi-institution
  "strictest among all active permissions" model, matching PathScribe's
  actual single-case-focused UI. New: `Config/System/SessionSecuritySection.tsx`,
  `services/session/` (restructured mid-session into a proper
  interface/mock/firestore-stub trio, see `services/session/README.md`),
  `hooks/useIdleTimeout.ts`, `Common/SessionExpiryWarningModal.tsx`.
  `Client.idleTimeoutMinutesOverride` added and wired into the Client
  Dictionary edit modal.

  **Phase 2 (draft caching + recovery) also now complete** β€” new
  `services/drafts/`, `hooks/useDraftCache.ts`, `Common/DraftRecoveryModal.tsx`,
  wired into `SynopticReportPage.tsx`. Caches the full case (18 distinct
  dirty-able things found via a full `markDirty()` call-site audit, not
  just synoptic answers β€” an earlier, narrower version would have missed
  most of them), explicitly excluding patient demographics for HIPAA
  minimum-necessary reasoning and data-integrity (avoiding a stale
  restore overwriting fresh LIS/EHR data). Local-only restore, no
  auto-persist. Full detail in `Config/README.md`, `Common/README.md`,
  and `ClientDictionary/README.md` (the per-client override field).
