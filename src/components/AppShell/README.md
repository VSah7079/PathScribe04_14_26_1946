# components/AppShell/

## Files

- **`AppShell.tsx`** (1542 lines, the largest single-file folder in
  components/) — Global layout shell wrapping all authenticated pages:
  logo/home nav, breadcrumb slot, Enhancement Request button, user
  initials badge, Quick Links, logout, `<Outlet />`. Owns
  `INTERNAL_USERS` — the real internal user/messaging directory (17
  entries, `u2`–`u17`), **not currently exported**. **See
  `RequestReview/README.md`** — this is the real directory that
  `RequestReviewModal.tsx`'s separately-maintained `REVIEWERS` list was
  supposed to mirror but has drifted from, with 2 real ID collisions
  (`u3`, `u4` mean different people in each list). Not fixed here — needs
  your input on whether `RequestReviewModal.tsx`'s reviewer pool is meant
  to be the same directory or a deliberately separate one.

  **Complete — messaging drawer inline-style extraction + real mobile
  support (Aug 2026).** Requested directly: the messaging feature
  ("Messages" in the nav) was flagged as generally useful but genuinely
  unusable on a phone. Root cause confirmed: `.ps-msg-drawer` was
  hardcoded to `width: 850px` — both in its own CSS class *and*
  redundantly duplicated inline in the JSX — more than double any real
  phone's viewport width, the dominant cause.

  Every inline `style={{...}}` and JS-based `onMouseEnter`/`onMouseLeave`
  hover handler across the entire feature — the outer drawer/top bar,
  `ComposePanel`, `MessageListPanel`, `ThreadPanel`, `SecureEmailModal`,
  and the secure-email toast — replaced with real, named CSS classes and
  proper `:hover`/`:focus-within` rules. `ComposePanel` needed no changes
  at all, already fully class-based. The rest did.

  **Real, worthwhile discovery along the way:** two entire, well-built
  CSS class systems already existed in `pathscribe.css` — one for message
  rows (`.ps-msg-row`, selected/unread/urgent variants, avatars) and one
  for chat bubbles/reply bar (`.ps-msg-bubble`, `.ps-msg-reply-bar`,
  etc.) — both with zero usage anywhere in the app. Genuine dead code.
  Rather than delete either or build new ones, both were wired into
  `MessageListPanel`/`ThreadPanel` respectively, resolving the dead-code
  question by finally connecting what had already been built for this
  exact purpose.

  **One real bug caught during the refactor itself, not after:**
  converting `ThreadPanel`'s outer container from an inline style to a
  class silently dropped `position: relative` along with everything else
  — which the "⋯" menu's absolute positioning depends on to anchor
  correctly. Caught by checking, not assumed; verified the fix directly
  (menu measured at exactly `0,0` relative to its container) before
  moving on.

  A real `ps-msg-drawer--detail-active` class + mobile media query
  collapses the two-column desktop layout (list | thread) into the
  standard mobile "list, then tap into a message" pattern, with a new
  back button. Verified working via real device-independent Playwright
  checks (see the testing-methodology note below) — both computed styles
  and rendered screenshots confirmed correct in both states.

  **Also investigated, confirmed not an issue:** a leftover
  `.ps-secure-email-modal { z-index: 25000 !important }` rule exists but
  is never applied to the actual component — checked whether this masked
  a real stacking bug; it doesn't, since `.ps-overlay`'s own `z-index:
  9000` (from the earlier modal-consolidation pass) is already well
  above the messages drawer's `1200`. Left as harmless, vestigial CSS
  rather than wiring in an unnecessary `!important` override.

  **Real, important correction to this session's own testing method,**
  worth recording here since it could affect how future mobile-CSS work
  in this file gets verified: `chromium.launch()` combined with
  Playwright's packaged `devices['iPhone 13']` profile reports the wrong
  `window.innerWidth` in this sandbox (980px instead of 390px), meaning
  CSS `@media` queries never actually fired in early verification
  attempts, despite screenshots looking visually narrow. Isolated
  precisely: a plain, manually-specified viewport (`{ width: 390, height:
  844 }`, no device-profile spreading) works correctly. All verification
  in this pass used the corrected method.


  real bug found along the way.** Three hand-rolled overlay shells
  converted to shared `ps-overlay`/`ps-modal-dark`/`ps-drawer-backdrop`
  classes: the NHSMail Secure Message compose modal, the account-menu
  drawer's backdrop, and the "About" popup. Found and fixed a genuine
  out-of-range z-index bug in the process — the About popup was hardcoded
  to `zIndex: 3000`, well outside this app's established tiers; now
  correctly `9000` via the shared class. The other two already had
  correct z-index values (`9000`, `1199`) and only needed the class
  conversion for consistency. Two other overlay-looking patterns in this
  file were deliberately left untouched, confirmed to be a different UI
  concept entirely: small invisible "click outside to close a dropdown"
  backdrops (transparent, local z-index, not a modal at all) and a
  bottom-center toast notification.

## Notes

- Naming drift worth knowing: `pages/SynopticReportPage/modals/` also
  had its own `LogoutWarningModal.tsx` — a genuine second implementation
  of the same dialog with a different prop interface, since consolidated
  into `components/Common/LogoutWarningModal.tsx`. Not this folder's
  concern directly, but the same "same-named component, different files"
  risk pattern worth being aware of anywhere in the app.
