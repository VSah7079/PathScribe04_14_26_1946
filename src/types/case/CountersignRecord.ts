// src/types/case/CountersignRecord.ts
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The general resident-drafts/attending-countersigns workflow — previously
// only a data model existed for this (Case.participants[] resident/attending
// types, SynopticReportInstance.requiresCountersign/countersignedBy/
// countersignedAt), with zero real code path that ever set any of it. This
// is that real workflow: a resident's "sign out" is intercepted before any
// finalize logic runs and diverted into a real CountersignRecord instead;
// the attending's later sign-out is the one that actually finalizes,
// closing the loop with real delta/feedback capture.
//
// Deliberately separate from ReconciliationRecord — that one is narrowly
// scoped to Frozen-to-Permanent discordance and only ever fires for cases
// with a merged intraop specimen. This fires for every resident-drafted
// case, frozen section or not, which is the actual majority of real
// teaching moments.
