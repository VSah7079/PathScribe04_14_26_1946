// Replaces the single-string comment field (both Case.order.
// accessionComment and Specimen.comment used to be a plain string,
// silently overwritten by whoever saved last) with a real, append-only
// thread — each entry is its own record with a real author and
// timestamp, nothing ever gets overwritten. Same shape used for both
// case-level and specimen-level comments.

   * Provenance resource both exist because "who wrote this" and "which
   * system does this comment live in" are different questions. A
   * comment with origin 'lis' was received from the owning LIS —
   * PathScribe can't edit or delete it, only append a new comment in
   * reply (which this whole type already only supports anyway, since
   * comments are append-only).
   *
   * Every comment authored through PathScribe's own composer (both
   * modals) is origin: 'pathscribe' — this is set automatically, not a
   * user choice.
