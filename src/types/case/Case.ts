/** 'assist' = LIS owns the report, PathScribe is read-only on lifecycle —

 *  only via explicit clinical actions (Sign-out, Submit for Review, Claim

 *  Renamed from 'copilot' (was the value here previously) for trademark
 *  safety — Microsoft holds a live registered trademark on COPILOT
 *  (USPTO Reg #6256123, Computer & Software Services class), and while
 *  the term has been used informally by other companies, this codebase's
 *  own use of "CoPilot" wasn't purely an internal code name — it
 *  surfaced in user-facing strings (a Contribution-dashboard label, a
 *  BottomActionBar tooltip). 'assist' was chosen specifically because
 *  it's a generic/descriptive word — legally the *safer* category, since
 *  generic terms are too weak to function as anyone's exclusive
 *  trademark, unlike a coined/stylized term like "Copilot" that reads as
 *  source-identifying. Not a substitute for real trademark clearance —
 *  a defensive rename made ahead of that, not instead of it.
 *
 *  Narrowed from the old 4-value union ("pathscribe" | "orchestrator" |
 *  "native" | "copilot") before this rename — 'native' had zero real
 *  usage anywhere in the app, and 'pathscribe' was already dead for
 *  detecting Orchestration mode (mockOrchestratorCaseService.ts switched
 *  to 'orchestrator' for that; see contextBuilder.ts's fallback, also
 *  fixed). */
