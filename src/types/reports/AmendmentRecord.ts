// src/types/reports/AmendmentRecord.ts
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Real Amendment/Addendum record — replaces what was a fully decorative
// feature: the modal existed and looked functional, but its submit
// handler never persisted anything at all (checked directly — closed
// the modal, showed a success toast, cleared the text field, done).
//
// Addendum: new information appended; original stays entirely
// untouched. Amendment: existing finalized information was wrong and
// is being corrected — requires an explanation and, per CAP/RCPath
// accreditation requirements, proof the treating clinician was
// actually notified. That notification log is the one field this spec
// calls "the most crucial audit trail," and it's a genuine hard gate
// here, not optional.
//
// Deliberately scoped: this captures the real amendment/addendum
// record — explanation, notification log, timestamps, authorship,
// sequencing. It does NOT attempt to version or re-edit the underlying
// synoptic answers themselves (a major diagnostic change like Benign
// → Malignant showing as live, edited text in the active report view,
// with the old text preserved in a parallel version history) — that's
// a substantially larger feature touching how report editing itself
// works, not something to half-build silently inside this pass.
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// Three parallel revision kinds, matching CAP accreditation language and
// HL7 result-status semantics ('C' = corrected vs. a revised-narrative
// amendment) rather than a single 'amendment' bucket with an internal
// severity flag — see AMENDMENT_STATUS_REDESIGN_BRIEF.md for the full
// rationale. 'correction' is administrative/clerical only (specimen site
// label, misspelled name) with the diagnosis unchanged — it does NOT
// carry the Clinical Notification hard gate that 'amendment' does (see
// captureFields/release in mockAmendmentService.ts), but still requires
// explanationOfChange for the audit trail.
export type AmendmentType = 'addendum' | 'amendment' | 'correction';

// Mirrors AmendmentType, plus 'original' for a report that has never been
// revised. Lives on SynopticReportInstance/Case (as `lastRevisionType`) —
// the case/instance-level "what was the most recent revision" flag that
// drives the Final (Amended) / Final (Corrected) / Final (Addendum)
// display label once status is 'finalized'. Kept separate from
// AmendmentType (the AmendmentRecord's own type) rather than reused
// directly, since 'original' has no meaning on an AmendmentRecord itself.
