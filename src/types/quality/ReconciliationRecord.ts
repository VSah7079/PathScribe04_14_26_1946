// src/types/quality/ReconciliationRecord.ts
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Renamed from DiscordanceRecord — the old model only ever wrote a record
// when a mismatch was found, so there was no real denominator anywhere
// for a concordance rate (numerator existed, total reviewed didn't). Per
// ISO 15189 / CAP audit-trail expectations, a QA log needs to prove
// process execution (a reconciliation happened) as well as findings (it
// was or wasn't discordant) — a concordant outcome is itself the
// evidence the mandatory frozen/final check actually occurred.
//
// Every reconciliation is now one ReconciliationRecord, always written,
// with outcome distinguishing concordant from discordant. The
// discordance-specific fields (delta/severity/rootCause) are only
// meaningful — and only required — when outcome is 'discordant'.
//
// Deliberately built around discrete categories (FrozenCategory on the
// intraop side, finalCategory here), not free-text diagnosis comparison —
// two short diagnoses can't reliably self-compare for discordance, but
// two categories from the same small set can. The pathologist confirms
// Delta/Severity/Root Cause themselves; none of that is inferred or
// auto-graded.
