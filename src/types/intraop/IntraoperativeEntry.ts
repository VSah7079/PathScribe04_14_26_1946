// src/types/intraop/IntraoperativeEntry.ts
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Real data model for the Intraop Pre-Check capture flow's desktop side —
// the "Unlinked Intraoperative Entries" queue. A session is created at
// the bench, lives here unmerged until a formal LIS accession arrives,
// then gets merged into the real case.
//
// A session != a specimen. One patient, one OR, one surgeon can send
// multiple specimens to the same intraop consult (the mass plus a
// separate margin, multiple sentinel nodes, etc.) — re-scanning the same
// patient and re-entering the same OR/surgeon for each one would be real,
// avoidable friction at a bench, so patient/OR/surgeon are captured once
// per session, and each specimen underneath carries its own milestones,
// Quick Gross, and frozen diagnosis.
//
// Milestones are workflow tracking, not a hard gate — logged in real
// sequence with real timestamps, including explicit skip reasons when a
// step is deliberately bypassed (e.g. "Direct to Frozen" on dense,
// fibrotic tissue that won't yield a usable touch prep). The desktop
// merge screen is where that sequence becomes visible to someone with
// full case context, not a blocking check at capture time — a stressed
// resident at a messy bench should never be locked out of logging the
// next real step. The Quick Gross gate is the one deliberate exception —
// see mockIntraoperativeService's addMilestone for why.
