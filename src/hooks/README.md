# src/hooks/

Reusable stateful logic used across pages/components — session
timeout, draft caching, screen capture, companion windows, voice,
audit logging, and a few smaller single-purpose hooks.

## Files

- **`useIdleTimeout.ts`** — session inactivity warning/expiry
  countdown. Genuinely excellent: correctly handles background-tab
  `setTimeout`/`setInterval` throttling by re-deriving state against
  `Date.now()` on tab-visibility-change rather than trusting however
  many ticks a throttled timer happened to fire, and carefully avoids
  a stale-closure bug (a ref mirrors `showWarning` specifically so the
  activity listener — registered once, not on every warning-state
  toggle — always reads the current value). One unnecessary `any`
  cast removed (`caseData?.order?.clientId` — `caseRouter.getCase()`
  already returns a properly typed `Case | undefined`).

- **`useDraftCache.ts`** — debounced draft auto-save +
  restore-on-mount, backing the Inactivity Timeout & Draft Recovery
  spec. **Real, severe bug found and fixed** — per direct report,
  "timeout worked, but no restore dialog appeared on re-entry."
  Reproduced precisely: the underlying service call always succeeded
  at finding the draft, but a redundant `checkedKeyRef` guard (meant
  to prevent re-checking, already handled correctly by this effect's
  own dependency array) actively broke React 18 Strict Mode's mount →
  cleanup → re-mount cycle — this app's real root (`main.tsx`) renders
  inside `<React.StrictMode>`. The first invocation started the real
  `getDraft()` call and set the ref; Strict Mode's cleanup marked that
  same closure `cancelled`; the second, surviving invocation saw the
  ref already set and skipped calling `getDraft()` again entirely; the
  first call's promise then resolved successfully but was discarded
  because its own closure had been cancelled. The draft was being
  found and silently thrown away on every single re-entry. Fixed by
  removing the redundant guard. Verified the fix is real, not just
  compiled: reproduced the bug live with a genuinely injected draft
  first, confirmed the modal failed to appear, fixed it, confirmed the
  identical reproduction now works end-to-end (including clicking
  Restore), then proved the new regression test
  (`useDraftCache.test.ts`) actually catches this specific bug by
  temporarily reintroducing it and confirming exactly the
  Strict-Mode-rendered test case fails. `confirmRestore`/`discardDraft`
  are currently identical implementations but semantically distinct
  actions from the caller's perspective — left as two separate
  functions rather than merged, since collapsing them would cost
  future extensibility (e.g. logging restore vs. discard rates
  separately) for no real benefit today.

- **`useScreenCapture.ts`** — PHI-redacted screenshot capture for the
  Enhancement Request support-ticket modal. **Found and fixed the
  most serious issue in this whole review — see `PRIORITY_FIXES.md`
  item #34.** The `html2canvas` capture's `ignoreElements` option
  excluded the PHI redaction overlay divs themselves from the render,
  which (confirmed by reading `html2canvas`'s own clone-tree logic,
  and then confirmed *empirically* with an isolated reproduction
  rendered through the real library) meant the overlay never actually
  painted — the real PHI content underneath, a separate DOM node the
  overlay was never attached to, rendered fully visible in every
  captured screenshot. Fixed and re-verified with the same empirical
  method, not just re-compiled. One more small cleanup alongside it:
  `catch (err: any)` changed to the `unknown`-plus-cast pattern already
  established elsewhere in this codebase.

- **`useCompanionWindow.ts`** — the "keep a reference window open
  alongside the app, reuse it across clicks, remember where the user
  dragged it" hook (Clinical Links, PubMed ticker). Two `any` casts on
  `getScreenDetails()` (the Window Management API) are correctly
  left as-is — confirmed no TypeScript DOM lib type exists for this
  API, same situation as `SpeechRecognition` in `VoiceProvider.tsx`.

- **`usePreviewChannel.ts`** — **removed entirely, see
  `PRIORITY_FIXES.md` item #33.** Implemented a real, sophisticated
  cross-window live-preview system (BroadcastChannel sync,
  window-geometry persistence, popup-blocked handling) whose sender
  half had zero consumers anywhere in the app. Traced what actually
  serves the two things it was meant to do — printing
  (`SynopticReportPage.tsx`'s own working `handleOrchPrint`, a real
  server-PDF-plus-fallback mechanism) and live-updating preview while
  editing (`SynopticReportPage.tsx`'s inline `ReportPreviewRenderer`,
  updating automatically via ordinary React re-rendering, no
  cross-window messaging needed) — confirmed with Pete this was
  superseded, dead architecture, and removed along with
  `ReportPreviewPage.tsx`, the `/report-preview/:caseId` route, and a
  dormant event listener that could never fire once the only thing
  that dispatched its event was gone.

- **`usepathscribeSpeech.ts`** — thin, intentionally-narrow wrapper
  over `VoiceProvider`'s full context (see
  `contexts/VoiceProvider.tsx`). Documents itself as "the primary hook
  for all voice interactions across the app," but only 1 of 9 actual
  voice-consuming files uses it — the other 8, including
  `OrchestratorSectionEditor.tsx` (exactly where the wrapper's own
  usage example says dictation happens), call `useVoice()` directly
  instead. Not a bug — both paths correctly read the same underlying
  context — but a real, confirmed drift between documented and actual
  usage. Flagged rather than force-migrated, since some of those 8
  files clearly need fields the narrower wrapper doesn't expose
  (`accent`, `voiceEnabled`, `aiAvailable`). Removed its `isProcessing`
  re-export as part of `VoiceProvider.tsx`'s own dead-code cleanup
  (see `contexts/README.md`).

- **`useSynopticAudit.ts`** — wraps `logEvent()` +
  `sendSynopticNotification()` for synoptic template audit events. The
  hook itself was clean (one unnecessary `any` cast removed — the
  notification service already accepts `SynopticAuditEvent` directly).
  Its only real consumer, `TemplateRenderer.tsx`, had a more
  significant issue: **every real field-edit audit call
  (`set_single_answer`, `set_text_answer`, both multi-answer variants,
  and the lifecycle-transition notification) omitted `user` entirely**,
  meaning every one of them fell through to this hook's hardcoded
  `DEFAULT_USER = 'Dr. Reviewer'` fallback — real edits by real
  pathologists were being logged under a fake placeholder name in a
  compliance-relevant audit trail. `TemplateRenderer.tsx` already had
  the real user resolved and available (`currentUser`, derived from
  `useAuth()`, already correctly used two lines below for a *different*
  call) — just never threaded through to these specific calls. Fixed
  by passing `user: currentUser` to all four. Found and removed 9
  more unnecessary `any` casts in the same file while there (every
  action-string literal genuinely matches the real
  `SynopticAuditAction` union — confirmed by reading the full type,
  not assumed), and one inconsistent duplicate fallback string
  (`user?.name ?? 'Dr. Reviewer'` re-derived inline a few lines below
  the already-correct `currentUser` variable) consolidated to reuse
  the existing one.

- **`useTerminologyAlerts.ts`** — debounced SNOMED/ICD
  deprecated-code scanning for the synoptic template editor. Clean.

- **`useSessionSupersedeDetection.ts`** — detects same-user login from
  another tab via the native `storage` event (which the browser
  correctly never fires in the tab that made the write, avoiding any
  self-triggered false positive). Small, clean, correct.

- **`useFocusTrap.ts`** — WCAG 2.1 SC 2.1.2 keyboard focus trap for
  modals. The hook itself is correct and clean. Worth flagging: only
  one component in the entire app (`FlagConfigPage.tsx`) actually uses
  it, despite dozens of modals existing across the codebase. Not
  confirmed as a gap — verifying that would mean auditing every modal
  individually, out of scope for this pass — but worth a dedicated
  look given the WCAG relevance.

- **`useLogout.ts`**, **`useLatestResearch.ts`** — small, clean,
  properly adopted (5 and 1 consumers respectively, no bypasses
  found).

## Real findings this pass, ranked by severity

1. **Draft recovery completely non-functional** (`useDraftCache.ts`) —
   confirmed and fixed. See `PRIORITY_FIXES.md` item #109. A React 18
   Strict Mode interaction silently discarded every found draft before
   it ever reached the UI — the entire Inactivity Timeout & Draft
   Recovery feature's core promise (don't lose a pathologist's unsaved
   work on session timeout) never actually worked. See this file's own
   entry above for the full mechanism.
2. **PHI redaction silently non-functional** (`useScreenCapture.ts`) —
   confirmed and fixed. See `PRIORITY_FIXES.md` item #34.
3. **Audit trail attributing real edits to a fake user**
   (`TemplateRenderer.tsx`, via `useSynopticAudit.ts`) — confirmed and
   fixed. See `PRIORITY_FIXES.md` item #32 (folded in alongside the
   contexts/ review since it was found while auditing that hook).
4. **Disconnected dead feature removed** (`usePreviewChannel.ts`) —
   confirmed with Pete and removed. See `PRIORITY_FIXES.md` item #33.
5. **Documented-vs-actual API drift**
   (`usepathscribeSpeech.ts`/`useVoice()`) — flagged, not fixed, not a
   bug.
6. **Possible focus-trap coverage gap** (`useFocusTrap.ts`) — flagged,
   not verified further, out of scope for this pass.
