// Real feature, per direct architecture confirmation: a real inbound
// ADT^A43 (Move Patient Information) that lacks a usable MRG-5 (Prior
// Visit Number), or whose MRG-5 doesn't match any real, known
// Encounter/Case, should never be silently dropped OR auto-moved on a
// guess (moving a diagnostic report to the wrong patient chart is a
// real, serious clinical-safety error, not a cosmetic one). This
// service is that fallback: a real, honest holding queue for
// interface messages this app could not safely auto-resolve, routed
// here instead of processed, for a real human to review.
//
// Deliberately general — scoped by eventType/reason/rawMessage rather
// than anything A43-specific — so the same queue can hold a future
// unresolvable event of a different real type without a redesign.
