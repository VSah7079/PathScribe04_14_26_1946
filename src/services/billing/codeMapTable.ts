// Real fix: no CPT-to-wRVU mapping existed anywhere in this app before
// this file - ProductivityTab.tsx's and ContributionDashboardPage.tsx's
// RVU tiles were both entirely hardcoded because there was nothing real
// to compute from. This is the real, minimal Code_Map_Table this
// project's own earlier billing-scope planning called for ("small
// curated Code_Map_Table (CPT→wRVU)").
//
// Deliberately a small, curated subset of common anatomic pathology
// codes, not the full CMS CPT file - matches the original scope
// decision. Work RVU values below were verified via direct search
// against the current CMS 2026 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule
// (PPRRVU2026_Apr_nonQPP), not estimated or fabricated. These are work
// RVUs specifically (physician effort/skill component only), not total
// RVU (which also includes practice expense and malpractice
// components) - the physician-productivity number this app's RVU tiles
// have always been about.
//
// IMPORTANT, honest scope limits:
//   - This is NOT a billing system. No claims are generated, no payer
//     rules are applied, no modifiers are tracked. This is workload/
//     productivity tracking only - see WORKLOAD_AND_CHARGE_CAPTURE_SCOPE.md
//     for the fuller reasoning already established for this project.
//   - wRVU values are published, national CMS figures and do not
//     reflect state/locality GPCI adjustments, which this app does not
//     model.
//   - This table covers five of the most common anatomic pathology
//     codes (surgical pathology levels III-V, first IHC stain) - it is
//     deliberately not exhaustive. Extending it with more real,
//     verified codes is real, separate future work, not something to
//     pad out with guessed values now.
