// AI Provider abstraction layer.
//
// All AI generation in PathScribe flows through this interface.
// The rest of the system never references a concrete provider —
// it only knows IAIProvider. This enables:
//   • Provider swapping without code changes (Claude ↔ GPT ↔ Bedrock)
//   • Mock provider for demos and offline testing (zero API cost)
//   • Audit logging at a single choke point
//   • Future multi-provider routing per client/subspecialty
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

   *  matched every section's shared case-context header block
   *  (e.g. the "─── GROSS DESCRIPTION ───" line is present in every
   *  prompt regardless of which section is the actual target),
   *  causing every section to resolve to the same canned text.
   *  Optional — real providers ignore it; only the mock provider
   *  needs it, since it has no real model to actually understand
   *  the prompt's own explicit "you are generating the X section"
   *  framing. */
