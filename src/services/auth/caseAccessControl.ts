// src/services/auth/caseAccessControl.ts
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Lives alongside institutionService.ts (this folder's existing
// "current session tenant" helper — see that file's own header for why
// its previous implementation was broken and got fixed alongside this).
// The real hospital/organisation access-control boundary — replaces the
// hardcoded USER_HOSPITAL_MAP that used to live inside mockCaseService.ts's
// listCasesForUser() and was NEVER enforced on getCase()/getAll(), meaning
// any user with a case ID (via search, a shared link, etc.) could open a
// case belonging to any hospital, in any organisation, regardless of that
// map. That was found and is being closed here.
//
// Design principles (standard multi-tenant SaaS / healthcare access model,
// chosen specifically to hold up under HIPAA "minimum necessary," UK
// GDPR/DSPT, EU GDPR data minimisation, and equivalent AU/CA frameworks —
// none of these are unique, all are the same shape: deny by default,
// explicit scope, auditable):
//
//   1. DENY BY DEFAULT. No organisationId resolved on the session → no
//      case access, full stop. Never fall back to "show everything" on a
//      missing/failed lookup.
//   2. Organisation is the tenant wall. A case belongs to exactly one
//      Organisation (resolved via getOrganisationByHospitalId — Case.
//      originHospitalId legacy-maps 1:1 to an Organisation, not a Site;
//      see that function's own comment). A user can only see cases whose
//      Organisation matches their own organisationId.
//   3. Enterprise-wide visibility within your own organisation is the
//      DEFAULT once the tenant check passes — not a separate opt-in flag.
//      This matches both the actual data granularity available today
//      (Case doesn't carry a real Site-level identifier, only the
//      Organisation-granularity legacy hospital ID) and the explicit
//      requirement that a Trust-wide pathologist can see across their own
//      enterprise. True single-site-only restriction within one
//      organisation isn't buildable without Case carrying a real Site.id
//      instead — flagged as a deliberate limitation, not built here.
//   4. role: 'superadmin' bypasses the organisation check entirely — the
//      standard "platform admin" pattern (a genuine PathScribe-internal
//      support role needs cross-tenant visibility; an ordinary user's
//      home organisation should not). This is a real, if blunt,
//      instrument — see this file's own note in the accompanying
//      conversation about how many existing demo login credentials are
//      already hardcoded to this role.
//   5. Single enforcement point. This module is called from CaseRouter.ts
//      — the one façade every case-read path in the app already funnels
//      through (getCase/getAll/listCasesForUser) — rather than being
//      duplicated inside each underlying mock service. Duplicated
//      authorization logic is exactly how the old narrow hospital-map
//      hack happened: written once for one list view, never applied
//      anywhere else, and nobody could easily tell it wasn't real
//      enforcement.
//   6. Denied access returns "not found," not an explicit "forbidden."
//      This is a deliberate choice (OWASP-aligned) to avoid confirming a
//      case exists to someone not authorized to see it — but the audit
//      log entry underneath still distinguishes an actual not-found from
//      a denied access, so the compliance record stays accurate even
//      though the API surface is deliberately vague to the caller.
//
// IMPORTANT CAVEAT — read before treating this as "solved":
// This is a client-side mock. A real backend MUST enforce this
// server-side; a check running in the browser can be bypassed by anyone
// editing their own JS. What's built here models the correct SHAPE of
// the access-control decision (deny by default, explicit tenant scope,
// audited) so the real backend implementation has a clear, already-
// reasoned spec to match — it is not itself a security boundary against
// a malicious client.

// resolveCaseAccess() — the real, unified access decision.
//
// Adapted from a real ABAC/ReBAC dimensional model (four dimensions:
// tenant boundary, facility/lab scope, pool/subspecialty, case
// relationship), scaled to what's real and buildable in this codebase
// tonight rather than a full policy-engine rebuild:
//
//   Dimension 1 (Tenant Boundary)     — real, enforced: canAccessCase()
//     above, unchanged, still the tenant wall.
//   Dimension 2 (Facility/Lab Scope)  — deliberately pass-through today.
//     This file's own existing design principle #3 already covers this:
//     Case has no real Site-level identifier, so "enterprise-wide within
//     your own organisation" IS the correct current behavior, not a gap.
//     Kept explicit here rather than silently skipped, so a future
//     Case.siteId addition has an obvious place to plug in.
//   Dimension 3 (Pool/Subspecialty)   — NEW, real enforcement, added
//     here. Found via direct investigation: Subspecialty.userIds
//     ("Members / assigned physicians") was a real, populated field
//     never once consulted by anything gating visibility. Fixed here,
//     but deliberately safe to turn on: gated behind
//     Subspecialty.isWorkgroupEnabled, which is false on every currently
//     seeded subspecialty — so this has zero effect on any existing
//     case's visibility today, and only restricts a pool once an admin
//     explicitly opts it in via Config -> System -> Subspecialties. Same
//     deny-by-default-but-backward-compatible shape as everything else
//     in this file.
//   Dimension 4 (Case Relationship)   — NOT read-access; this dimension
//     governs WRITE guards (finalize/sign-out), not visibility — a
//     pathologist who isn't yet a case participant must still be able to
//     see and claim a pool case, that's the entire point of a pool. See
//     canFinalizeCase() below instead.
//
// IMPORTANT CAVEAT — same as canAccessCase() above: this is a client-side
// mock. Real enforcement of dimension 3 needs the equivalent check added
// to firestore.rules, not just here.
