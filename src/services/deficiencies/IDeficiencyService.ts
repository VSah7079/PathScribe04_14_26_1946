// The general-purpose Specimen/Requisition Deficiency pattern — modeled
// on CoPathPlus's Specimen/Requisition Deficiency + Resolution dictionary
// pair, reviewed earlier this session. First concrete use: "Could Not
// Match Specimen to Dictionary" (Accession page order import), but the
// pattern is deliberately generic — any future deficiency type (label
// mismatch, container damaged, insufficient volume, missing requisition)
// reuses this same engine, not a bespoke flag per scenario.
//
// Two small admin-curated dictionaries (DeficiencyType, ResolutionType)
// plus the actual records (SpecimenDeficiency) raised against a specimen
// and resolved by whoever has the context to resolve it — deliberately
// NOT the "unblock now, admin approves later" governance pattern used
// for Physician/Client/SpecimenCategory. That pattern fits an unrecognized
// *code* with an unambiguous key to dedupe against (NPI, Client.assigningAuthority).
// A deficiency doesn't have that — it's a workflow event, not an entity
// needing deduplication — and per the design discussion, the person
// best positioned to resolve it (the accessioner, looking at the actual
// specimen and order) should do so directly, not defer to an admin queue.
