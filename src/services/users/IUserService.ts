   * The Organisation (services/organisation/organisationService.ts) this

   * Added June 2026 to close a real access-control gap: before this,
   * NOTHING tied a user to an organisation at all. The only "hospital
   * scoping" that existed was a hardcoded USER_HOSPITAL_MAP buried inside
   * mockCaseService.ts's listCasesForUser(), which only filtered which
   * pool cases appeared in a worklist list view — it was never enforced
   * on getCase()/getAll(), meaning any user with a case ID (via search,
   * a shared link, etc.) could open a case from any hospital regardless
   * of that map. That map is retired; this field plus
   * services/auth/caseAccessControl.ts is the real enforcement,
   * applied in getCase()/getAll()/listCasesForUser() on both case
   * services, not just one list view.
   *
   * Undefined/null = no organisation = no case access (deny by default),
   * except for role: 'superadmin' sessions, which bypass this check
   * entirely — the standard "platform admin" pattern for a genuine
   * PathScribe-internal support role that legitimately needs cross-tenant
   * visibility, as opposed to an ordinary user's home organisation.
   *
   * Case data today only carries Organisation-level granularity
   * (Case.originHospitalId legacy-maps 1:1 to an Organisation, not a
   * specific Site — see getOrganisationByHospitalId's own comment) — so
   * "can this user see this case" currently is exactly "does the case's
   * organisation match the user's organisation." A user with access to
   * their organisation sees all of that organisation's cases, which is
   * the correct default per the enterprise-wide-within-your-own-org
   * requirement. True sub-organisation (single-site-only) restriction
   * would need Case to carry a real Site.id instead of the legacy
   * Organisation-granularity hospital ID — a separate, deeper migration,
   * not built here; flagged so this isn't mistaken for finer-grained
   * access control than actually exists.
