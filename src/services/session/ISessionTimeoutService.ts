// src/services/session/ISessionTimeoutService.ts
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Service interface for idle-session-timeout resolution.
// Dev: mockSessionTimeoutService (localStorage-backed org default +
//   per-performing-lab override lookup via clientService)
// Live: FirestoreSessionTimeoutService (not yet built — stub only)
//
// Phase 1 of the Inactivity Timeout & Draft Recovery spec (see
// PRIORITY_FIXES.md #13). Structurally mirrors
// components/Config/AI/orchestratorModeConfig.ts's proven org-default/
// per-client-override shape, but as a real services/ interface/mock pair
// rather than a components/-local module — that earlier version lived
// directly under services/session/ without following this codebase's
// established interface/mock/firestore-stub pattern, caught and
// corrected by Pete before it drifted further.
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// keeps that detection self-contained rather than threading case context
// through every page that renders a case. Not part of the service
// interface itself since it does no data access at all, just string
// parsing — both the mock and (eventual) real implementation would need
// it identically.
