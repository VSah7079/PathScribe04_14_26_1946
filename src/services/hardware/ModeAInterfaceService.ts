// src/services/hardware/ModeAInterfaceService.ts
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Dispatches a ModeAOrderPayload through the EXISTING HL7 seam
// (ormBuilder.ts -> segmentBuilders.ts for the standard core, then
// IHL7VendorAdapter for vendor-specific transformation) rather than a new,
// parallel, incompatible pipeline. This is deliberate: services/hl7/ already
// has the "build a verified-standard message first, apply vendor quirks
// only as a transformation on top of it" discipline, specifically so
// nothing here ever needs to guess at Vantage/Cerebro-specific field
// layouts without a real integration guide. See vantageAdapter.ts's own
// comment for the full history of why that discipline exists.
//
// Only BLOCK_ORDER is actually wired today, because that's the only event
// type the real ormBuilder.ts currently knows how to build
// (buildOrmO01ForBlock — one message per block's stain orders, the real
// orderable unit). SLIDE_ORDER and SPECIMEN_LABEL throw a clear
// "not yet supported" error rather than silently faking a message-building
// path that doesn't exist — same standard as the adapter layer itself.
