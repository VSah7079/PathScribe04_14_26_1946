// Real Master Patient Index (MPI) — the missing piece found while tracing
// why "Patient History" couldn't reliably surface a patient's prior
// cases: Case.patient.id was generated as `OPAT-${caseId.slice(4)}`,
// derived from the CASE, not the PERSON. The same real-world patient with
// two different cases got two completely unrelated patient ids — there
// was no actual person-level identity anywhere in the data model, only
// whatever the MRN text field happened to match (and per the same
// investigation, MRN alone doesn't meet the Joint Commission's
// two-identifier minimum for patient-identification-critical actions).
//
// Deliberately MPI, not EMPI: scoped per organisationId, not global
// across every PathScribe customer. You would not want one lab
// organisation's patients cross-matched against a completely different,
// unrelated organisation's — that's not deduplication, that's a real
// privacy violation. A true EMPI (matching across institutions) is a
// substantially different, larger scope than what a single-lab MPI needs,
// and isn't what's being built here.
//
// Deliberately deterministic, not probabilistic: a real production-grade
// EMPI product (4medica and similar) does weighted, probabilistic
// candidate scoring across many demographic fields — a genuinely
// substantial engineering effort in its own right, not something to
// reproduce from scratch in the time available. What's built here is the
// real, correct FOUNDATION that a future probabilistic layer would sit
// on top of: an actual persistent per-organisation patient identity,
// checked on every accession, with anything not confidently resolvable
// deterministically routed to a human for review rather than silently
// auto-matched or silently duplicated. That routing-to-review behavior
// is the genuinely load-bearing safety property here, not the
// specific matching algorithm's sophistication.
