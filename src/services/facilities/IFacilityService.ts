// src/services/facilities/IFacilityService.ts
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Canonical Facility type + service interface. Replaces IClientService.ts's
// Client entirely (renamed, not a new type sitting alongside the old one).
//
// Real feature, per direct confirmation: "One record per facility. Multiple
// roles attached to that record... Example: Facility: Fenwick General
// Hospital — Role: Performing Lab, Role: Internal Submitting Location,
// Role: Internal Ordering Client (if applicable), Role: HL7/FHIR Routing
// Endpoint (if applicable). This keeps the identity unified while allowing
// the system to treat the facility differently depending on context."
//
// Replaces the old clientType: 'internal' | 'external' toggle (which forced
// a facility to be exactly one of two things, and drove the domain leakage
// this whole redesign started from — AI/timeout settings living on every
// Client regardless of type) with `roles: FacilityRole[]`. Config sections
// are now gated by role membership, not by a fixed internal/external
// branch: HL7 settings only apply when hl7_routing_endpoint is present, AI
// Orchestrator/Model/idle-timeout only apply when performing_lab is
// present (confirmed directly: "AI inference is strictly part of the
// performing lab's diagnostic workflow... AI configuration should be gated
// exclusively by the performing_lab role"), report delivery/TAT/escalation
// only apply when an ordering-client role is present.
//
// The AI/timeout settings that briefly lived in their own
// services/performingLabs/IPerformingLabService.ts (a real, separate
// service + its own admin screen) are folded directly back onto Facility
// here — that split solved the domain-leakage problem but created a real
// workflow problem instead ("I would need to go to the client dictionary
// to create the internal client, update those settings, then go to the
// performing lab section to apply those responses, not very good
// workflow"). One record, one screen, sections gated by role checkboxes,
// is the actual fix for both problems at once.
