// Real feature, per direct confirmation: "we will need to accept PV1 HL7
// data, but I don't believe we have Location / Rooms defined in config.
// They would naturally be associated to the Facility."
//
// Confirmed before building: real PV1 parsing already existed
// (services/hl7/adtParser.ts's parsePV1) and already fed a real Encounter
// entity (services/encounters/) — but ward/room/bed/facility were always
// plain free-text strings, with zero structured dictionary behind them.
// Any string arriving in an inbound PV1 was accepted and stored as-is.
//
// This is that dictionary — scoped to facilityId, matching the confirmed
// design ("naturally associated to the Facility"). Same
// findOrCreateByAssigningAuthority-style resolution pattern already
// established for Facility/Physician/SpecimenCategory: a real match
// resolves cleanly, no match auto-creates an Unverified record for admin
// review rather than silently accepting unvalidated data or dropping it.
//
// Real HL7 PV1-3 (Assigned Patient Location) component structure, per
// direct confirmation ("include the standards") — modeling the full,
// real 8-component structure this app's parser is extended to read, not
// just the 4 (pointOfCare/room/bed/facility) it read before:
//   PV1-3.1 Point of Care        PV1-3.5 Location Status
//   PV1-3.2 Room                 PV1-3.6 Person Location Type
//   PV1-3.3 Bed                  PV1-3.7 Building
//   PV1-3.4 Facility              PV1-3.8 Floor
// (PV1-3.4 Facility is the HL7 message's own facility code for this
// location, distinct from this app's Facility.id — kept as a raw string
// for crosswalk/audit, same posture as other raw-vs-resolved id pairs
// elsewhere in this app.)
//
// locationStatus (PV1-3.5, HL7 Table 0306) and personLocationType
// (PV1-3.6, HL7 Table 0305) are both real, standard HL7 tables, but
// explicitly "user-defined" in the spec itself — sites commonly extend
// them. Modeled as guided free text (a real, standard suggested list,
// not a closed enum) rather than a rigid union that could reject a
// legitimate, real site-specific value.
