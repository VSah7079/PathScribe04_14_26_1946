# services/grossingRoutingOverrides/

Admin-managed per-client exceptions to a Specimen Category's default Grossing Template.

**Pattern:** Standard interface/mock/firestore pattern.

## Notes

- Real gap this closed: AccessionPage.tsx always passed an empty overrides array before this admin screen existed — this is that screen's real data layer, not new design.
